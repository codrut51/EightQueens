## Description

A while back I heard of a problem about chess and it intrigued me. The problem states:

On a chess board 8 x 8, how many queens (we are going to refer to them as a x number of queens) can you put on the board without them being able to attack each other.
To make the problem a bit more complex how many possible arrangements/combinations of the found x number of queens can be computed for a 8 x 8 grid/board.

Additionally for any given number (n >= 3 && n <= 8) calculate the x (max number of queens) and the number of possible arrangements for these queens on the n x n board.
(**Optionally**: A visual representation can be given of the possible arrangements )  

### My method of approach
I think someone out there can find an even better way to do this but I will choose a very popular approach to this problem.

#### ToDo 
* [x] Add main class
* [ ] Add backtracking class
* [ ] Add simple logic of backtracking class (all possible arrangements for a number n)
* [ ] Improving logic for the problem at hand 
* [ ] Build, documentation, & getting started
